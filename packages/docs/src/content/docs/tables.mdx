# Creating Tables

Once you've [installed blinkDB](/docs/installation), you can create your own database.

```ts
import { createDB } from "blinkdb";

const db = createDB();
```

Similar to a relational database, entities are stored in Tables in blinkDB.
You can create them with `createTable<Interface>(db, <name>)()` (be sure to 
call `createTable` twice, like in the example below). Each table contains
entities of a certain type.

Every table requires a TS interface/type that specifies what entities in that
table look like. You can use almost all typescript types in your entity definition
(see the list of valid property types [here](/docs/reference/createtable#valid-entities)).

```ts
import { createDB, createTable } from "blinkdb";

interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const db = createDB();
const table = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
```

ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations - it's that simple! You can now [create, query, update, and delete items](/docs/crud).
