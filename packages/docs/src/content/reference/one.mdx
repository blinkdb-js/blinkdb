# one()

Retrieves one entity from the table.

This is similar to [`first()`](/docs/reference/first) in the sense that it retrieves only the first matching entity, but:

- it throws an exception if no entity was found
- it throws an exception if more than one entity matched the filter

This makes it perfect for retrieving entities by their primary id, which are unique by default.

```ts
let alice: User;
// Retrieve directly by id
alice = await one(userTable, "alice-uuid");
// Retrieve with filter (equivalent to the line above!)
alice = await one(userTable, {
  where: {
    id: "alice-uuid"
  }
});
```

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `table`      | The table created by [`createTable()`](/docs/reference/createtable) .                                     |
| `filterOrId` | Either a filter or an id. The item returned will be the first one to match. See [filters](/docs/filters). |

## Retrieve by primary id

In case an id is given as the second parameter, `one()` will return either the entity with a matching primary id,
or throw as detailed above.

```ts
const alice = await one(userTable, "alice-uuid");
```

## Retrieve by filter

If the second parameter is a [filter](/docs/filters), `one()` returns the item that matches the filter,
or throws if no or more than one item is available.

```ts
const alice = await one(userTable, {
  where: {
    id: "alice-uuid"
  }
});
```
