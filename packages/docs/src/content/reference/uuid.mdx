# uuid()

Returns a uuid - an universally unique identifier. You can use this as the primary key for entities.

This uses [hyperid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperid) under the hood, which is one of the fastest
methods for uuid generation.

```ts
const aliceId = uuid();
await insert(userTable, { id: aliceId, name: "Alice", age: 23 });
```
