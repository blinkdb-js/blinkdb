# createTable()

Creates a new table where entities can be inserted/updated/deleted/retrieved.

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const userTable = createTable<User>(db, "users")();
```

| Parameter | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `db`      | The database created by [`createDB()`](createdb) . |
| `name`    | Name of your table. For future usage.              |

| Option    | Description                                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary` | The primary key of the entity. See [Primary Keys](#primary-keys)                  |
| `indexes` | Fields of the entity on which an index should be created. See [Indexes](#indexes) |

## Valid Entities

The interface you pass to `createTable()` defines what properties are available on your entity.
Valid property types are primitives (`string`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `undefined`, `BigInt`), `Date`s,
arrays, and complex objects. You cannot use symbols or functions as a type.

```ts
interface ValidEntity {
  name: string;
  isDeleted: boolean;
  age: number;
  surname: string | null;
  likesPizza: boolean | undefined;
  ageInMs: BigInt;
  createdAt: Date;
  nicknames: string[];
  some: {
    nested: {
      object: boolean;
    };
  };
}
```

## Primary keys

BlinkDB automatically assumes that the primary key of a table is `id` , if not otherwise supplied:

```ts
// `uuid` should be the primary id
interface Task {
  uuid: string;
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
}

const userTable = createTable<Task>(db, "tasks")({
  primary: "uuid",
});
```

## Indexes

Indexes are a valuable performance improvement for databases by reducing the amount of items scanned per query.
To use them effectively, specify properties here that are often used in filters when you call
[`first()`](first) / [`one()`](one) / [`many()`](many) / [`watch()`](watch) -
This will increase speed for queries drastically, with only a small performance hit on writes.

At startup, BlinkDB will automatically create a primary key index for you.

```ts
interface User {
  id: string;
  // Email will often be used in filters, better create an index
  email: string;
  // No need for an index on Age - it won't be specified much in filters
  age: number;
}

const userTable = createTable<Task>(db, "tasks")({
  primary: "uuid",
  indexes: ["email"],
});
```
