# watch()

Observes changes in the table.
Whenever an entity is inserted, updated, or deleted, blinkDB calls the provided callback
with all table entities.

`watch()` is much, much faster than manually retrieving items everytime you insert, update, or remove.
It's perfect for usage inside reactive components like React Hooks.

```ts
// Call `callback` whenever ALL entities change
await watch(userTable, (users) => {
  console.log("All users: ", users);
});
// Call `callback` whenever an item matching the filter changes
await watch(userTable, { where: { age: { lt: 3 } } }, (babies) => {
  console.log("All babies: ", babies);
});
```

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `table`    | The table created by [`createTable()`](createtable) .                                        |
| `filter`   | Optional. If present, `callback` will only be called when a changed item matches the filter. |
| `callback` | The function which will be called whenever an item is inserted/updated/deleted.              |

## Stop observing changes

If you want to stop watching for changes, call the function returned by `watch()`.

```ts
const stop = await watch(userTable, (users) => {
  console.log("All users: ", users);
});

// Stop watching changes
stop();
```
